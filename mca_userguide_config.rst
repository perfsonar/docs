Under "Configs" tab, you immediately see "Auto Mesh Config". Auto Mesh Config a special meshconfig which is generated by aggregating all tests defined in vairous
meshconfig for a specific host. Auto meshconfig is useful if you want to configure a toolkit instance so that it will run all tests defined by any meshconfigs 
rather than picking a specific meshconfig.

To generate Auto meshconfig, simply choose a hostname from the hostname dropdown list.

Mesh Config List
----------------------------------
