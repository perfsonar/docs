Updating Administrative Information
***********************************

The Toolkit allows you to enter contact and location information about the host. This information will not only display on the main page but will be published in the perfSONAR Lookup Service allowing other testers to find your host. This page contains information on editing this information through the web interface. 

For more information about your personal data read our `Privacy Policy <https://www.perfsonar.net/about/privacy-policy/>`_.

Accessing the Administrative Info Interface

#. Click on **Edit** in the host information section of the main page (A) or **Configuration** button in the right-upper corner (B) and login as the web administrator user created in the previous step.

                The email address where correspondence regarding this host may be sent. Since this e-mail address should be used only for communication related to the operations of the specific node, it is highly recommended that a role or group e-mail address is used instead of a personal one.

Adding Node Metadata
====================
Node metadata are optional tags that can be used as a means to describe a host on the **Global node directory** page. There are two types of metadata tags:
    .. glossary::
        
        Node Role
            It describes the node roles in the domain. It helps potential users of this node to recognize the place of node installation in the owners' domain. You may select multiple Roles for a node.
            
        Node Access Policy
            It is used to indicate the access policy for a node: whether it's a public access node, private with no access, R&E only or with limited access. You may select only one Access Policy for a node.
            
In order to tag a node with metadata:

    #. In order to add a Node Role, under **Metadata**, click in the field **Node Role**. A drop-down list shows with possible values. Click on a preferred value to select it. Repeat this step to add more tags.
    
            .. image:: images/manage_admin_info-meta-add-role.png
    #. In order to add a Node Access Policy, under **Metadata**, click in the field **Node Access Policy**. A drop-down list shows with possible values. Click on a preferred value.
    
            .. image:: images/manage_admin_info-meta-add-policy.png
    #. You may also add a descriptive note in **Access Policy Notes** field which is a human readable text that can optionally be added to help further describe the access policy.
    
    #. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

Deleting Node Metadata
======================
You may remove a particular node metadata with the following steps:
    
    #. Under **Metadata**, find the tag you wish to remove and click **x** beside the name.
    
        .. image:: images/manage_admin_info-meta-delete.png
    #. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

Selecting From Existing Communities
===================================
Communities are self-defined tags that can be used as a means to search for a host on the **Global node directory** page. There are two ways to select from existing communities. One method is to select from the list of existing communities or by typing the known community (note that communities are case-sensitive):

    #. Under **Communities**, click the field *Select communities*. A list will be shown with existing communities. Select your choice.
    
        .. image:: images/manage_admin_info-comm-select.png
    #. You may also start typing the known community in the field *Select communities* to match against existing communities.
    #. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

Adding a Community
==================
In case there is no existing community of your choice, add it manually by typing the community with the following steps:

    #. Under **Communities**, click **+Add a community**
    
        .. image:: images/manage_admin_info-comm-add1.png
    #. At the prompt, type in the community you want to add (case-sensitive) and click **Add** when done.
    
        .. image:: images/manage_admin_info-comm-add2.png
    #. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

Deleting a Community
====================
You may remove your host from a particular community with the following steps:
    
    #. Under **Communities**, find the community you wish to remove and click **x** beside the name.
    
        .. image:: images/manage_admin_info-comm-delete.png
    #. Click **Save** to apply your changes.
