System Requirements
*******************

The hardware requirements of the perfSONAR Toolkit largely depend on the type of measurements you plan to run. A few things should be considered when choosing hardware:

* At a bare minimum the perfSONAR Toolkit is a customized distribution of |CentOS|_ so it must meet the `minimum requirements <http://wiki.centos.org/About/Product>`_ of that operating system. 
* In addition, it is recommended you look at the `hardware selection <http://www.perfsonar.net/deploy/hardware-selection/>`_ page of the main perfSONAR web site for a detailed discussion of hardware considerations. It contains examples of many configurations including virtualized environments, high performance bandwidth testing and others. 
* It is also recommended you look at our :doc:`manage_tuning` section for details on how to get the most out of your deployed hardware.
* If you want to run Debian 7, Ubuntu 12 or Ubuntu 14, we currently only provide the perfSONAR TestPoint bundle for those distributions.  See :doc:`install_debian` for more information.
