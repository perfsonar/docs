<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>perfsonarUI is a web application for running and visualizing on-demand tests between perfSONAR measurement points (MPs) or visualizing historical measurement results obtained from perfSONAR measurement archives (MAs). It is designed to be intuitive and user friendly, thus allowing the network operator the troubleshoot network problems as efficiently as possible. The application functionality itself is realized through several plugins, one for each supported type of measurement. In the current version, perfsonarUI supports fetching stored interface utilization data, one-way delay data, jitter data, one-way packet loss data, hop count information data and achievable throughput data. This data is stored in perfSONAR MAs and represents results of regularly scheduled measurements which are performed automatically. The UI also offers the possibility of requesting an on-demand measurement of achievable throughput or one-way latency between two perfSONAR MPs. In the future other types of measurements will be added to the UI in the form of new plugin panels.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="_images/using_psui-01welcome.png" src="_images/using_psui-01welcome.png" />
</div></blockquote>
<p>perfsonarUI also supports using historical data from multiple MAs to visualize path segment utilization for a given traceroute output.</p>
<p>The current release of perfsonarUI has been tested with the following perfSONAR components:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>perfSONAR Toolkit v 3.4.1</li>
<li>esmond v 1.0</li>
<li>BWCTL MP v 1.0</li>
<li>RRD MA v 3.3.1-1</li>
<li>SQL MA v 2.4</li>
<li>HADES MA v 0.53</li>
<li>OWAMP MP v 0.53</li>
<li>simpleLookupService</li>
</ul>
<p>If a particular component version is not included in this document it may still be compatible with perfsonarUI but has not been tested.</p>
<p>In addition perfsonarUI is also able to retrieve data from the old perfSONAR Toolkit, v3.3.1, SNMP MA and perfSONAR-BUOY MA. It is also able to make on-demand tests to <em>bwctl</em> endpoint such as perfSONAR Toolkit BWCTL and one-way latency measurement between a perfSONAR OWAMP MP and another <em>owamp</em> endpoint (such as perfSONAR Toolkit OWAMP endpoints).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-to-the-application">
<span id="psui-usage-access"></span><h2>Access To the Application<a class="headerlink" href="#access-to-the-application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>perfsonarUI is available through any modern web browser. We recommend using latest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari and Opera. Accessing the application through Internet Explorer 9-11 is not tested, but should be operational. Accessing the application through Internet Explorer 8 is very limited – charts are not functional at all in IE8 and also there are several issues with style rendering such as element color, position, font type and size and more. For that reason accessing perfsonarUI through Internet Explorer versions 8, 7, 6 and lesser is not supported. To access your instance perform the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Start your web browser</li>
<li>In the URL field of the browser, enter the IP address of the server running the instance of perfsonarUI. This will look similar to: <em>http://your_server_IP_address:8080/perfsonar-ui/</em></li>
<li>Access to the application is secured. After the installation perfsonarUI is configured to use only embedded database for authentication. To login press <strong>perfSONAR UI Login</strong> button. When the login window displays enter default credentials. Default username is <strong>admin</strong> with the password <strong>admin</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Minimum recommended screen resolution is 1024x768 pixels.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is possible to change these credentials or add additional ones by modifying the <em>/usr/share/perfsonar-ui-web/perfsonar-ui/WEB-INF/classes/usersdetails.xml</em> file. Each newly defined username should be in the role <em>ROLE_USER</em> since this is currently the only role supported by perfsonarUI. The <em>ROLE_USER</em> role allows full access to the application. A more sophisticated control over user roles and credentials will be implemented in future versions of the application. To produce MD5 hash of the desired password use an MD5 hash generator. You can do it easily on the Linux CLI with a command such as <strong>echo -n &#8220;password&#8221; | md5sum</strong>. After finishing changes in <em>usersdetails.xml</em> file you need to restart the Tomcat service.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="content-organization">
<h2>Content Organization<a class="headerlink" href="#content-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The application main window is organized in two main sections: time window selection with navigation on the left side of the screen and the plugin content panel on the right. Time window selection, located in the top left part of the screen, allows the user to select a common time window. This time window will be used when querying historical measurement data.</p>
<p>The start and the end of the time window can be selected manually by clicking on the corresponding input field and selecting date and time from a pop-up. It is also possible to select one of pre-defined time windows. These are (last) <strong>hour</strong>, (last) <strong>6 hours</strong>, (last) <strong>day</strong> and (last) <strong>week</strong>. Selection of these intervals is done by simply clicking the corresponding button in the bottom row. These intervals are relative to the current time, meaning that the end of the time window is set to current time and beginning is set according to the interval duration. Using the top row of buttons the user can shift the current time window backwards and forwards. Buttons <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> shift the time window backwards and forwards for its duration, while buttons <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>&gt;</strong> shift for half of time window duration.</p>
<img alt="_images/using_psui-02timeselection.png" src="_images/using_psui-02timeselection.png" />
<p>The navigation panel is located below the time window selection and currently has three sections. The <strong>Access</strong> section is used for plugin selection, <strong>Analyze</strong> section is used for analyzing traceroutes and cross-referencing them with perfSONAR measurements, while the <strong>Settings</strong> section is used to configure the UI itself.</p>

<h2>perfSONAR Service Selection Panel<a class="headerlink" href="#perfsonar-service-selection-panel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Each perfsonarUI plugin requires a perfSONAR service (Measurement Point or Measurement Archive) or endpoint (like <em>bwctl</em> or <em>owamp</em>) to be selected from the list of preconfigured services specific to that particular plugin (refer to section <a class="reference internal" href="#configuration-of-the-ui">Configuration Of the UI</a> -  for more information about configuring service list). Selecting desired service for querying is done via service selection dialog.</p>
<div class="section" id="selecting-service">

<div class="section" id="accessing-historical-measurements">
<h3>Accessing Historical Measurements<a class="headerlink" href="#accessing-historical-measurements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>perfsonarUI currently supports the visualization of three types of historical measurements. These are link utilization data, one way delay, jitter, one-way packet loss and traceroute for a path and measured achievable throughput for a path. For each measurement type, there is a dedicated plugin within the <strong>Access</strong> section of the navigation panel. Each of the plugins will be described in more detail below.</p>
<div class="section" id="accessing-link-utilization-data">
<h4>Accessing Link Utilization Data<a class="headerlink" href="#accessing-link-utilization-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">On the <strong>Access</strong> section of the navigation panel of the perfsonarUI you will see <strong>Access utilization data</strong> link. Click this item to bring up the link utilization plugin in the content panel on the right side of the application screen. This plugin is used to visualize data from the perfSONAR RRD MA and is also able to retrieve data from perfSONAR BUOY MA and the old perfSONAR Toolkit SNMP MA. Initially the page has content with no data:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="_images/using_psui-07historical_link_util1.png" src="_images/using_psui-07historical_link_util1.png" />
<p>The plugin panel is divided into several segments. On the very top are controls for the selection of a measurement archive service to be queried (1) and for the type of values to be displayed in the results (utilization can be shown in bps or % of capacity). Next is a list of interfaces for which data is available in the measurement archive (2). Below that is a panel showing details of selected interfaces (3) and finally, the bottom part of the panel is reserved for the graph showing inbound and outbound link utilization for the selected time window (4).</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Once a desired interface is located and selected by clicking in the list, a request is sent to the measurement archive to provide measurement values for that interface.

<p>In the details panel interface name, description, address, domain and capacity are shown, alongside the status, maximum and average utilizations for each direction. The graph shows how the utilization changed over time in the selected time window. There are two elements on the graph. The green, filled area represents the inbound utilization while the blue line represents the outbound utilization. The graph provides the following functionalities:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Graph zooming: The graph can be zoomed in by clicking a mouse and dragging it to mark a selection area.</li>
<li>Comparison of link utilization in graph: It is possible to compare the utilization of two interfaces within the same time window. This is done by simply clicking on another interface from the list while there is already an active selection.</li>

<p>The graph represents a series of individual available throughput tests with identical parameters, which were performed in the past. Each of these tests consists of more than one value represented by a dot. One distinct value is the average achieved throughput shown as a blue dot. There are also several values which represent throughput achieved during reporting intervals (green dots). For example, if a single test lasted 30 seconds and had a reporting interval of 6 seconds this means that there will be 5 reporting interval values (one every 6 seconds of the test) and one average value. Each of the individual tests can be clicked and viewed in more detail.</p>

Creating a new account on Feide OpenIdP is free and has no restriction. However, using Feide OpenIdP is discouraged in production, and you should use your home organization&#8217;s IdP. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Firstly, IdP metadata is needed. Every IdP advertises its own metadata at a well-known URL.

<li>In the section <strong>Configuration and metadata for this service provider</strong>, provide either a pkcs12 file or a Java keystore file and enter the password for the keystore in the section below. The remaining information in this section will appear in your home organization&#8217;s service inventory, so enter <strong>Organisation Name</strong>, <strong>Organisation URL</strong>, <strong>Technical email contact address</strong> accordingly. When you press the <strong>Configure System</strong> button, all metadata will be placed in the <em>/usr/share/tomcat6/.oiosaml</em> directory.
