#. Using your favorite software, burn the image to a CD, DVD or USB drive and insert the chosen installation media into your host.  

    .. note:: Linux and Macintosh users may consider using the dd tool: *sudo dd if=/PATH/TO/FILE.iso of=/dev/DISK*
#. Follow the prompts provided by the CentOS installer to install the required packages. If you have installed a Linux operating system before, these prompts should be relatively self-explanatory.

#. Once the installation completes and the host reboots, login from the console using the root password you created during the previous step
#. You will be prompted to create a user and password that can be used to administer the host through the web interface. Follow the prompts to complete this step.
