Upgrading from pre-4.2.0 versions
===================================================================================

Upgrading
---------

If you are upgrading from an older version of MCA to the new PWA, you may want to do a clean install and manually copy any configuration settings you have changed over to the new PWA config.

Files that have changed/that you need to change

* ``/etc/mca`` or ``/etc/pwa`` moves to /etc/perfsonar/psconfig-web
* within /etc/perfsonar/psconfig-web:

  * index.js

    * change the name of the mongo db. The old name was ``mca``\ , new is ``pwa`` -- if you want to start completely fresh, leave this as ``pwa``. if you want to retain your configs, change this back to ``mca`` to use your existing database.

  * shared/mca.ui.js moves to shared/pwa.ui.js

    * update the url path from ``../api/mca`` to ``../api/pwa``
    * change the title from "MeshConfig Admin" to "pSConfig Web Admin"

  * shared/auth.ui.js

    * change title to "PWA Authentication Service"
    * change logo_400_url to ``images/pscweb_logo.png``

You will also need to add the new ``pwa`` role to each user:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker exec -it sca-auth /app/bin/auth.js modscope --username user --add '{"pwa": ["user"]}'

To make them an admin:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker exec -it sca-auth /app/bin/auth.js modscope --username user --add '{"pwa": ["admin"]}'
