* *Grid:* A two-dimensional representation of one or more *rows* and *columns* of *checks* that measure some value between entities represented by the column value (x) and row value (y).
* *Check:* The output of a task performed using the column value (x) and the row value (y) as input.
* *Column:* A collection of checks that share a common x value. 
* *Row:* A collection of checks that share a common y value
* *Cell:* A collection of checks that share a common x and y value
