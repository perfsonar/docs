Introduction
=============
Everything in pScheduler begins with requesting a :term:`test` which in turn will be carried-out by a :term:`tool`. When you run the ``pscheduler task`` command the first required argument is the test type and all arguments that follow are dependent on the type of test. The document aims to give you a list of tests and their corresponding tools provided by a default pScheduler installation on perfSONAR. It also tries to give an idea of the options available in each and other important details. 

.. note:: This document highlights the list of test types and tools installed by default when installing pScheduler with perfSONAR. It is possible for others to write their own test and tool plug-ins so this list may not be exhaustive of all tests and tools available.

.. _pscheduler_ref_tests_tools-test_classifications:

Test Classifications
======================
Each test classified in one of four categories that determines what other tests can be run in parallel:

    #. **Exclusive** - These are tests that cannot run at the same time as any other exclusive or normal test. An example is a *throughput* test. If you have very frequent tests in this category then you may have difficulty finding a timeslot for new tests.
    #. **Normal** - These are tests that can run at the same time as other normal and background tests, but cannot run at the same time as exclusive tests. An example is a task with a test type of *latency*.
    #. **Background** - These are tests that can be run in parallel with any other test including exclusive, normal and other background tests. Example test types include *rtt*, *trace*, *http*, *dns* or *clock*. Since these runs do not prevent other runs from executing though, they should not limit your ability to schedule new tests.
    #. **Background-multi** - These are tests that can be run in parallel with any other test and produce multiple results that appear as separate runs. Example test type is *latencybg* that runs continuously.
	
You may visualize different types of tests using ``pscheduler plot-schedule`` command. See also :ref:`pscheduler_client_schedule-plot_schedule`.

You can know which scheduling class a test belongs to by running the ``pscheduler plugins tests`` command.

The currently supported latency tools are *owping* (used by default) and *twping*.  When using *twping* the destination (``-d``) can be any network device acting as a TWAMP Server and Session-Reflector, see `RFC-5357 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5357>`_ for more details (TWAMP Light is currently not supported by perfSONAR).
