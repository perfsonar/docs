Troubleshooting Docker Containers
==================================

**If you are not using Docker, SKIP THIS PAGE**

Use the ``docker ps`` command to list the running containers.

You should see all 5-6 containers running (again, ``postfix`` is optional).

.. code-block:: shell

    # docker ps
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                                              NAMES

    0c03b689c722        yorkshirekev/postfix   "/startservices.sh mc"   3 weeks ago         Up 3 weeks          0.0.0.0:587->25/tcp                                                postfix

Note: sometimes, docker containers will initially not have connectivity to the outside world. Usually this can be resolved by running ``systemctl restart docker``. If you are experiencing this issue, make sure your firewall rules are not being overridden by config management software (puppet, ansible, etc).

Troubleshooting Containers
---------------------------

Use the ``docker logs`` command to see logs for a container. Adjust ``--tail`` to change how many logs are displayed. Add the ``-f`` flag to watch the logs as new records come in (like ``tail``)

.. code-block:: shell

    # docker logs pwa-admin1 --tail 10

Interacting with containers
----------------------------

You can enter an interactive ``bash`` shell within a container like this:

.. code-block:: shell

    [root@hostname ~]# docker exec -it pwa-admin1 bash
    root@2dd0cd671538:/# ls
    app  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  start.sh  sys  tmp  usr  var
    root@2dd0cd671538:/# ls -l app/api/config
    total 12
    drwxrwxr-x 2 11264 11264  146 Jan 24 22:06 auth
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 11264 11264 6096 May 23  2018 index.js
    drwxrwxr-x 4 11264 11264 4096 Jan 25 20:44 nginx
    drwxrwxr-x 2 11264 11264   55 May 23  2018 shared

Or directly execute commands like this:

.. code-block:: shell

    [root@hostname ~]# docker exec -it pwa-admin1 ls /app/api/config
    auth  index.js  nginx  shared


Firewall
--------

Docker will take care of its own firewall rules, so you don't have to worry about opening ports manually. 

By default, following are the ports used by nginx container:


* 443 (For PWA administrative GUI)
* 80 (For PWA configuration publisher)
* 9443 (For x509 authentication to PWA administrative GUI)
