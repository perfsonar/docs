OPPD
****

Since the perfSONAR 4.0 release, the Open perfSONAR Perl Daemon (OPPD) is deprecated.  It's usage is not needed anymore as most of its features are superseeded by pScheduler (see :doc:`pscheduler_intro`).  For release 4.0, the OPPD packages are still installed by a regular perfsonar-toolkit installation, but the service is not started.  The OPPD packages will be completely removed from our repositories starting with perfSONAR release 4.1.

If you rely on this daemon for some tools or developments of your own, please get in touch with the perfSONAR community to seek alternatives.
