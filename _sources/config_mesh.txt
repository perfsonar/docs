********************************
Mesh Configuration (.conf) file
********************************

Overview
========

The perfSONAR MeshConfig software allows an administrator to generate a central file that defines measurements for a set of hosts that read the published file. The file is defined by the administrator in Apache config format. This document covers this format and the complete listing of options available.

Each configuration file consists of the following elements:

* A list of **description** providing a human-readable string that names your mesh. See :ref:`config_mesh-description` for details on defining this element.
* A list of **administrators** responsible for the configuration file. See :ref:`config_mesh-administrator` for details on defining this element.
* A list of *organizations* including the **sites** and **hosts** that they contain. See :ref:`config_mesh-organization` for details on defining this element.
* A list of **test specification** that describe the parameters of the tests to be run. See :ref:`config_mesh-test_spec` for details on defining this element.
* A list of **groups** the describe the topology of tests and the hosts they contain. See :ref:`config_mesh-group` for details on defining this element.
* A list of **tests** that connect the previously defined *test specifications* and *groups*. See :ref:`config_mesh-test` for details on defining this element.
* An optional set of **host classes** that allow for dynamic joining of tests to groups. See :ref:`config_mesh-host_class` for details on defining this element.


Naming
======

.. _config_mesh-description:

description Directive
----------------------
:Description: A human-readable name for the parent directive
:Syntax: ``description TEXT GOES HERE``
:Contexts: top level, :ref:`organization <config_mesh-organization>`, :ref:`site <config_mesh-site>`, :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>`, :ref:`host <config_mesh-test>`
:Occurrences:  Exactly one per parent
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

The description is a human-readable name applied for the parent element. It is primarily relevant to 
GUIs for display purposes. For example, MaDDash configurations uses this field as the title of the created dashboard in the top-level context. Likewise it uses this field as the name displayed for each host in the rows and columns of a grid in the :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` context.  


Grouping
=========

.. _config_mesh-organization:

<organization> Directive
------------------------
:Description: An optional construct that groups together sites and hosts by the organization to which they belong
:Syntax: ``<organization>...</organization>``
:Contexts: top level
:Occurrences:  Zero or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

The <organization> directive is strictly of purposes of grouping elements managed by the same entity together. In addition to keeping :ref:`sites <config_mesh-site>` and :ref:`hosts <config_mesh-host>` in a logical order, the description field can also be matched on when defining :ref:`host classes <config_mesh-host_class>`.


.. _config_mesh-site:

<site> Directive
----------------
:Description: An optional construct that groups an organization's hosts together, generally based on location
:Syntax: ``<site>...</site>``
:Contexts: :ref:`organization <config_mesh-organization>`
:Occurrences:  Zero or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

A site can group hosts within an organization together. For example, if an organization has multiple campuses with two hosts deployed at each, then the site directive can be used to group the hosts at each campus. This example is illustrate below::

    <site>
        description Site 1
        <host>...</host>
        <host>...</host>
    </site>

    <site>
        description Site 2
        <host>...</host>
        <host>...</host>
    </site>

The <site> may have additional significance for tools that display data. For example, a MaDDash configuration can plot data on the same graph for hosts belonging to the same site. This is especially useful when different types of measurement data are spread across multiple hosts, such as throughput and one-way delay data. 


Hosts
=====

.. _config_mesh-host:

<host> Directive
----------------
:Description: Describes a host that will be used as an endpoint in measurements
:Syntax: ``<host>...</host>``
:Contexts: top level, :ref:`organization <config_mesh-organization>`, :ref:`site <config_mesh-site>`
:Occurrences:  Zero or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

The host object is a critical part of your mesh configuration. You may define a host object at the top level of the file or within an organization or site. The latter two options simply provide more metadata about the host that can be used for documentation purposes or for :ref:`hos class <config_mesh-host_class>` matches. Inside the construct you will define all the addresses which may be used for performing network measurements to/from this host as well as some additional metadata.

.. _config_mesh-host-no_agent:

no_agent Directive
-------------------------------
:Description: A boolean indicating that his host does NOT read the mesh
:Syntax: ``no_agent 0|1``
:Default: 0
:Contexts: :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>`
:Occurrences:  Zero or One
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

If set to 1, this value indicates that the host in question is not reading the mesh. This is significant because it means those that test to it are responsible for initiating tests in both directions and storing the results. The default is 0 meaning other testers can assume this host is reading the mesh and will initiate its portion of the tests accordingly. 

.. _config_mesh-host-toolkit_url:

toolkit_url Directive
-------------------------------
:Description: A URL to the host's perfSONAR Toolkit instance or other related web site
:Syntax: ``toolkit_url URL``
:Contexts: :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>`
:Occurrences:  Zero or One
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

This option is for graphical displays that wish to provide a link to more information about the host. traditionally this is a link to the perfSONAR Toolkit, but may in practice be any valid URL.

.. _config_mesh-address:

<address> Directive
--------------------
:Description: An IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or hostname belonging to a host
:Syntax: ``address ADDRESS`` or ``<address>...</address>``
:Default: 0
:Contexts: :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>`
:Occurrences:  One or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later for simple form, 3.5 and later for complex form

An address is a required element of a host that defines an IPv4address , IPv6 address or hostname assigned to an interface on the host. You can and likely will define multiple of these for a single a host. If using a hostname it is not required to also define theIP addresses to which the hostname maps as the tools will do the look-ups automatically. 

You can define address in one of two forms. In the simple form you simply provide the address. Example::

    address 10.0.1.1
    
In the complex form you make it a block and can optionally add the *tags* field to label the address. Tags are used when defining a :ref:`host class <config_mesh-host_class>`. Example::

    <address>
        address 10.0.1.1
        tag latency
    </address>

address Directive
-------------------------------
:Description: In the complex form of <address>, a simple string representation of the IPv4, IPv6 address or hostname
:Syntax: ``address ADDRESS``
:Contexts: :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>`
:Occurrences:  Zero or One
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

Storing Results
===============

.. _config_mesh-ma:

<measurement_archive> Directive
--------------------------------
:Description: Defines where measurement results are stored
:Syntax: ``<measurement_archive>...</measurement_archive>``
:Contexts: top level, :ref:`organization <config_mesh-organization>`, :ref:`site <config_mesh-site>`, :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>`
:Occurrences:  One per <measurement_archive> type
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

The <measurement_archive> defines where measurements of a certain type are stored. Depending on where it is placed in the document it can have the following semantics:

* If placed in the <host> directive, then all measurements initiated by that host(and matching the measurement archive type) will be stored in the provided MA
* If placed in the <site> directive, all measurements initiated by hosts defined in the site will use the provided measurement archive UNLESS a <measurement_archive> is defined in the <host> directive.
* If placed in the <organization> directive, all measurements initiated by hosts defined in the organization will use the provided measurement archive UNLESS a <measurement_archive> is defined in the <site> directive OR the <host> directive (with <host> given preference).
* If placed in the top level, then all hosts will use the defined <measurement_archive> UNLESS there is <measurement_archive> defined in the <host>, <site>, or <organization> (with preference given in that order). 

type Directive
--------------
:Description: The type of measurement archive
:Syntax: ``type perfsonarbuoy/bwctl|perfsonarbuoy/owamp|pinger|traceroute``
:Contexts: :ref:`measurement archive <config_mesh-ma>`
:Occurrences:  Exactly one
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

This specifies the type of data to be stored. The supported values refer to an older version of the perfSONAR software where different data types were stored in different archives. Even if the data ultimately ends up in the same archive you need to define multiple <measurement_archive> directives for each type of data you plan to store. The types have the following meanings:

* **perfsonarbuoy/bwctl** - Throughput tests such as those initiated by BWCTL running iperf or iperf3
* **perfsonarbuoy/owamp** - OWAMP tests initiated by the powstream tool
* **pinger** - Ping tests initiated by ping, bwping or OWAMP tests initiated by bwping running OWAMP
* **traceroute** - Any type of test initiated by bwtraceroute

read_url Directive
------------------
:Description: The URL where tools should query for results
:Syntax: ``read_url URL``
:Contexts: :ref:`measurement archive <config_mesh-ma>`
:Occurrences:  Exactly one
:Compatibility: 3.3 and later

This is the URL where tools, such as a MaDDash dashboard, will query for test results. In general, this value will be the same as the write_url if running the perfSONAR Toolkit 3.4 or newer. You may want it to be a different value if your server uses a different public address than it uses to store data, such as in a NAT environment.  


write_url Directive
--------------------
:Description: The URL where tools should send results to store
:Syntax: ``write_url URL``
:Contexts: :ref:`measurement archive <config_mesh-ma>`
:Occurrences:  Exactly one
:Compatibility: 3.3, ignored in 3.4, supported again in 3.5 or later

This is the URL where tools, such as regular-testing on the perfSONAR Toolkit, should send results. This value is only useful if your measurement archive is using IP authentication. if using API key authentication, you will need to define the measurement archive in your local regulartesting.conf file. This is because it is not safe for the MeshConfig to share login credentials in it's current form and would be difficult to manage in a large mesh. 

Defining Test Parameters
========================

.. _config_mesh-test_spec:

<test_spec> Directive
---------------------
:Description: The parameters to use when running a test that uses this specification. The NAME tag is used to reference the test_spec elsewhere in the configuration.
:Syntax: ``<test_spec NAME>...</test_spec>``
:Contexts: top level
:Occurrences:  Zero or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

The <test_spec> defines the parameters used when running a test. Every test_spec has a *type* directive that indicates what kind of test is to be run. A set of directives are available for each type that are then used to further refine the parameters of the tests that use this specification.

type Directive
--------------
:Description: The type of test to be run for tests using this specification
:Syntax: ``type perfsonarbuoy/bwctl|perfsonarbuoy/owamp|pinger|traceroute``
:Contexts: :ref:`test_spec <config_mesh-test_spec>`
:Occurrences:  Exactly one
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

The types have the following meanings:

* **perfsonarbuoy/bwctl** - Throughput tests such as those initiated by BWCTL running iperf or iperf3. See :ref:`config_mesh-test_spec-throughput` for directives specific to this type of test.
* **perfsonarbuoy/owamp** - OWAMP tests initiated by the powstream tool. See :ref:`config_mesh-test_spec-owamp` for directives specific to this type of test.
* **pinger** - Ping tests initiated by ping, bwping or OWAMP tests initiated by bwping running OWAMP. See :ref:`config_mesh-test_spec-ping` for directives specific to this type of test.
* **traceroute** - Any type of test initiated by bwtraceroute. See :ref:`config_mesh-test_spec-traceroute` for directives specific to this type of test.

You can specify on of the following tools for a traceroute test:

* **traceroute** - This is the default and generally the more reliable of the tools. It also includes more options in terms of setting the TTL and properly binding to interfaces.
* **tracepath** - The main advantage of this tool is it reports MTU by default. It has  fewer options than standard traceroute for setting TTLs and binding to local interfaces. It also is UDP-only and may be blocked by firewalls. It's also been reported to have a harder time with MTU mismatches on the destination host. 
* **paris-traceroute** - This is another approach to running traceroute that tries to identify load balanced routes and similar. It requires the client to grant the paris-traceroute command the CAP_NET_RAW privilege on the system in order to run as a non-root user.

Defining Test Topology
======================

.. _config_mesh-group:

<group> Directive
-----------------
:Description: Describes which tests should be run between a given set of addresses. The NAME tag is used to identify the group elsewhere in the configuration. 
:Syntax: ``<group NAME>...</group>``
:Contexts: top level
:Occurrences:  One or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

The group directive is one of the primary elements used for defining your configuration. Each group has a at a minimum a type and a list of members. The combination of these elements defines which tests are run. Each member of a group must reference either an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` defined in a :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` block or a :ref:`host_class <config_mesh-host_class>`. For example, the following defines a group named example_group where each host tests to every other host in the list (i.e. type is mesh). The first two addresses in the list are explicitly defined (10.0.1.1 and 10.0.1.2) and the third is a host class (host_class::ten_gige)::

    <group example_group>
        type mesh
    
        member 10.0.1.1
        member 10.0.1.2
        member host_class::ten_gige
    </group>

For more on the different types of groups, see the :ref:`group <config_mesh-group-type>` type section. 

.. _config_mesh-group-type:

type Directive
-----------------
:Description: The type of group, which further determines which options should be used in the rest of the group directive. 
:Syntax: ``type disjoint|mesh|ordered_mesh|star``
:Contexts: :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>`
:Occurrences:  Exactly one
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

The type can be one of the following values:

* **disjoint** - This type of test defines that tests are performed between a set of addresses in group A and a second set of addresses in group B. It is possible for an address to be in both groups. See :ref:`config_mesh-group-a_member`, :ref:`config_mesh-group-b_member` and :ref:`config_mesh-group-no_agent` for more information on defining members. Example::

    <group example_disjoint_group>
        type disjoint
    
        a_member 10.0.1.1
        a_member 10.0.1.2
        
        b_member 10.0.2.1
        b_member 10.0.2.2
    </group>
* **mesh** - This type of test defines that tests are performed between all addresses in the given list.  See :ref:`config_mesh-group-member` and :ref:`config_mesh-group-no_agent` for more information on defining members. Example::

    <group example_mesh_group>
        type mesh
    
        member 10.0.1.1
        member 10.0.1.2
        member host_class::ten_gige
    </group>
* **ordered_mesh** - A special type of group were the order an address is listed matters. The first address is responsible for testing to all the hosts listed below it, the second host is responsible for testing to all the hosts below that, etc until the last address is reached, which does not initiate any tests. This ultimately leads to a full mesh, with hosts toward the top of the list taking on a larger burden for initiating and storing tests. This may be desirable if you have a set of more powerful hosts (in terms of hardware) you can put toward the top of this list with less powerful hosts toward the bottom.   See :ref:`config_mesh-group-member` for more information on defining members.  Example::

    <group example_ordered_group>
        type ordered_mesh
    
        member 10.0.1.1
        member 10.0.1.2
        member 10.0.2.1
        member 10.0.2.2
    </group>
* **star** - A mesh where a single center address tests to all other members of the group.  See :ref:`config_mesh-group-center_address` and :ref:`config_mesh-group-member` for more information on defining members. Example::
    
     <group example_star_group>
        type star
        
        center_address 10.0.0.1
        
        member 10.0.1.1
        member 10.0.1.2
        member 10.0.2.1
        member 10.0.2.2
    </group>
    
.. note:: The functional equivalent of a **star** group can alternatively be defined as a **disjoint** group where the :ref:`a_member <config_mesh-group-a_member>` OR :ref:`b_member <config_mesh-group-b_member>` is the center_address.

.. _config_mesh-group-a_member:

a_member Directive
------------------
:Description: For disjoint type groups, defines an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` belonging to group A. This address will only test to addresses defined in group B using the :ref:`b_member <config_mesh-group-b_member>` directive and will NOT test to other addresses in group A (unless they are also in group B). Note that the address MUST map to an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` defined in one (and only one) :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` directive.
:Syntax: ``a_member ADDRESS``
:Contexts: :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>` where :ref:`type <config_mesh-group-type>` is *disjoint*
:Occurrences:  One or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

.. _config_mesh-group-b_member:

b_member Directive
------------------
:Description: For disjoint type groups, defines an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` belonging to group B. This address will only test to addresses defined in group A using the :ref:`a_member <config_mesh-group-a_member>` directive and will NOT test to other addresses in group B (unless they are also in group A). Note that the address MUST map to an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` defined in one (and only one) :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` directive.
:Syntax: ``b_member ADDRESS``
:Contexts: :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>` where :ref:`type <config_mesh-group-type>` is *disjoint*
:Occurrences:  One or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later


.. _config_mesh-group-center_address:

center_address Directive
------------------------
:Description: For star type groups, defines the :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` that will test to all other addresses defined by the :ref:`member <config_mesh-group-member>` directive. Note that the address MUST map to an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` defined in one (and only one) :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` directive.
:Syntax: ``center_address ADDRESS``
:Contexts: :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>` where :ref:`type <config_mesh-group-type>` is *star*
:Occurrences:  Exactly one
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

.. _config_mesh-group-member:

member Directive
-----------------
:Description: Defines an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` to be used in a group of various types (see Context row later in this table). Note that the address MUST map to an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` defined in one (and only one) :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` directive.
:Syntax: ``member ADDRESS``
:Contexts: :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>` where :ref:`type <config_mesh-group-type>` is *mesh*, *ordered_mesh* or *star*
:Occurrences:  One or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

.. _config_mesh-group-no_agent:

no_agent Directive
-------------------
:Description: Defines an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` that will not initiate tests when used in this group. This will override the :ref:`no_agent <config_mesh-host-no_agent>` field specified in the :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` directive if defined. It is recommended you use the host directive to define this if a address cannot initiate tests for any group. Only use this form if you want a host to initiate tests when used in some groups but not others. 
:Syntax: ``no_agent ADDRESS``
:Contexts: :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>`
:Occurrences:  Zero or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later


Defining Tests
==============

.. _config_mesh-test:

<test> Directive
-----------------
:Description: Maps a :ref:`test_spec <config_mesh-test_spec>` to :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>`.
:Syntax: ``<test>...</test>``
:Contexts: top level
:Occurrences:  One or more
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

A <test> directive is essentially the final step in defining the set of measurements to be run on participating hosts. By mapping a :ref:`test_spec <config_mesh-test_spec>` to a 
:ref:`group <config_mesh-group>`, you are declaring you want a test run with the parameters defined in :ref:`test_spec <config_mesh-test_spec>` for each point-to-point pair defined in :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>`. You also provided a :ref:`description <config_mesh-description>` to name the test. The :ref:`description <config_mesh-description>` has little significance to the tests themselves, but may be used for display purposes in a user interface, such as naming a grid in a dashboard. An example is below::

    <test>
        description Example BWCTL Tests
        test_spec example_bwctl_spec
        group example_mesh_group
    <test>

.. _config_mesh-test-test_spec:

group Directive
-----------------
:Description: The name of the group to use. The name must be exactly the NAME used when defining the :ref:`group <config_mesh-group>`.
:Syntax: ``group NAME``
:Contexts: :ref:`test <config_mesh-test>`
:Occurrences:   Exactly one
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

test_spec Directive
--------------------
:Description: The name of the test_spec to use. The name must be exactly the NAME used when defining the :ref:`test_spec <config_mesh-test_spec>`
:Syntax: ``test_spec NAME``
:Contexts: :ref:`test <config_mesh-test>`
:Occurrences:  Exactly one
:Compatibility: 3.3 or later

.. _config_mesh-dynamic_gen:

Dynamic Mesh Generation
=======================

.. _config_mesh-dynamic_gen-tag:

tag Directive
--------------
:Description: A custom string used to label an organization, site, host or address
:Syntax: ``tag TAG``
:Contexts: :ref:`organization <config_mesh-organization>`, :ref:`site <config_mesh-site>`, :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>`, :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>`
:Occurrences:  Zero or more
:Compatibility: 3.5 or later

The tag directive labels the parent object in a custom way. This label can then be used in a :ref:`config_mesh-host_class` definition to match items sharing the same tag. A good example is if you want to tag some <address> directives as "latency" and others as "throughput" on a dual-homed host. You can then define a host tag that selects only the "throughput" interfaces for throughput tests and "latency" interfaces for latency tests.

.. _config_mesh-host_class:

<host_class> Directive
-----------------------
:Description: Defines a set of criteria that if a host meets, then will be included in this class. the class can then be referenced by name in test definitions to include groups of hosts. 
:Syntax: ``<host_class>...<host_class>``
:Contexts: top level
:Occurrences:  Zero or more
:Compatibility: 3.5 or later

The <host_class> structure is one of the more complex in the MeshConfig. It is the foundational element in generating dynamic lists of hosts. A host_class has a *name* used to identify it, one or more *data sources* that contain an initial list of hosts, and a set of *filters* used to select hosts from the data sources that meet certain criteria. Optionally it may also have *host properties* used to set attributes on matching hosts such as measurement archives for storing test results. This host class can then be referenced in a :ref:`config_mesh-group` as a member using the notation *host_class::NAME* where NAME is the name of the hos class. For example, below we define a host_class that matches all hosts in our current mesh file (that's our data source in this case) belonging to organization Acme::

    <host_class>
        name      acme_org

        <data_source>
            type     current_mesh
        </data_source>

        <match>
           <filter>
               type   organization
               description   Acme
           </filter>
        </match>
    </host_class>
    
We could then letter reference this host_class in a group as follows::

    <group example_group>
        type mesh

        member 10.0.1.1
        member 10.0.1.2
        member host_class::acme_org
    </group>

An hosts we add to our mesh in the future with organization "Acme" will automatically get added to the test definitions using this group.

.. _config_mesh-dynamic_gen-match:

match Directive
---------------
:Description: Contains a list of :ref:`filters <config_mesh-dynamic_gen-filter>` that must be matched. An empty match filter matches everything. The :ref:`exclude <config_mesh-dynamic_gen-exclude>` directive takes precedence if they both match the same host. Within a match directive, :ref:`filters <config_mesh-dynamic_gen-filter>` of the same type have an implied OR condition and filter of a different type have an implied AND condition. 
:Syntax: ``<match>...</match>``
:Contexts: :ref:`config_mesh-host_class`
:Occurrences:  Zero or one
:Compatibility: 3.5 or later

.. _config_mesh-dynamic_gen-exclude:

exclude Directive
-----------------
:Description: Contains a list of :ref:`filters <config_mesh-dynamic_gen-filter>` that if matched, exclude the host from the class. An empty exclude filter matches excludes nothing. This directive takes precedence over the :ref:`match <config_mesh-dynamic_gen-match>` directive if they both match the same host. Within an exclude directive, :ref:`filters <config_mesh-dynamic_gen-filter>` of the same type have an implied OR condition and filter of a different type have an implied AND condition.

:Occurrences:  Zero or one
:Compatibility: 3.5 or later

.. _config_mesh-dynamic_gen-host_properties:

<host_properties> Directive
---------------------------
:Description: Defines properties to assign  hosts that match the specified class. Primarily used to set the measurement archives where test results will be stored. This is a :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` directive, so any sub-directives supported by :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` are also supported by host_properties. You do not need to set the address. In general, this will only contain :ref:`measurement archive <config_mesh-ma>` directives. If the properties set in the block conflict with any already set in an explicit :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>` directive, then the configurations will be merged. For measurement archives this means that both sets of archives will be used. 
:Syntax: ``<host_properties>...<host_properties>``
:Contexts: :ref:`config_mesh-host_class`
:Occurrences:  Zero or one
:Compatibility: 3.5 or later

The type of filter indicates what property of the address or its parent elements to match against. There are also some special filters that define boolean operations across multiple filters. The valid types and their meanings are:

* **address_type** - Matches addresses on hosts of the specified type (e.g. ipv4 or ipv6)
* **and** - A special operand that takes a set of filters and will return true if ALL filters match
* **class** - This takes the name of another class and only returns true if the host also belong to the specified class. This allows a simple form of inheritance between classes.
* **netmask** - Matches a address if it is in the specified IP netmask 
* **not** -  A special operand that returns true only if the underlying filters return false and vice versa
* **or** -  A special operand that takes a set of filters and will return true if ANY filters match
* **organization** - Matches the organization ref:`description <config_mesh-description>` of a host
* **site** - Matches the site ref:`description <config_mesh-description>` of a host
* **tag** - Matches a :ref:`tag <config_mesh-dynamic_gen-tag>` on an :ref:`address <config_mesh-address>` or its parent :ref:`organization <config_mesh-organization>`, :ref:`site <config_mesh-site>`, or :ref:`host <config_mesh-host>`
